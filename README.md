# EZOrder
EZOrder Android application

This is an application that my colleagues and I did for a collage course.
I did the coding whilst they helped with ideas an did most of the documentation.
My colleagues are: 
- Lucia Bolanča https://github.com/bolancalucia
- Bruno Boban
- Antonela Oršulić
- Veronika Ozretić
- Meri-Lucijeta Švragulja

IDEA:
This is an application that is used to help cooks, waiters and owners of restaurants. 
Every table gets one Android tablet device from whitch guests order food.
All of the cooks and waiters have one (moderator) account on which they can see a list of all unprocessed orders.
When they process an order, they remove it from the list and it automatically becomes proessed order.
Admin can see all processed orders and statistics.

REALISATION:
This is by no means an finished product, moderator and admin accounts still miss some of the functionalities.

- ADMIN: Username: Admin, Password: 1234.
- MODERATOR: Username: Moderator, Password: 1234.
- DB: Name: EZOrder, Username: test, Password: test.

ATTENTION
In folder SQLScripts there ar two scripts that you have to run before running application.
- EZOrderScriptSchema is an SQL script for empty database.
- EZOrderScriptSchemaData is an SQL script for filed database.

Both scripts miss DB & DB log adress, you have to fill that on your own.
